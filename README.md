# CSV_COMBINER_Challenge
A command line program that takes several CSV files as arguments. Each CSV file( found in the fixtures repository) will have the same columns. Output is  a new CSV file to stdout which contains the rows from each of the inputs along with an additional column that has the filename from which the row came. The script uses filename as the header for the additional column.
